  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "joy2twist" with
  any of the following names:

    joy2twistConfig.cmake
    joy2twist-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joy2twist" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "joy2twist_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "joy2twist" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
